## Requirements

Generate a password when the button is clicked:

1. Present a series of prompts for password criteria

- Length of password - user inputs a number
  - At least 8 characters but no more than 128
- Character types - user either confirms or cancels the browser dialog box
  - Lowercase
  - Uppercase
  - Numeric
  - Special characters ($@%&\*, etc)

2. Code validates for each input if at least one character type is selected.

3. Once prompts are answered then the password is generated and written to the
   page.
